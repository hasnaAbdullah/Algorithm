1. What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is an informal way of writing an algorithm using simple English and basic programming logic.
It is not a real programming language, so it does not follow strict syntax rules.

2. Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?
Why we use pseudocode:

To plan an algorithm before coding

To understand the logic clearly

To communicate ideas easily with others

To avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic

To make it easier to convert into any programming language later

When we use pseudocode:

Before writing actual code

During exams or assignments to explain logic

While designing algorithms

When learning programming concepts


3. How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm?

There is no single strict format, but common rules include:

General Rules:

Use simple English

Write steps in a logical sequence

Use keywords like:

START, END

INPUT, OUTPUT

IF, ELSE

FOR, WHILE

Indent blocks for clarity

Avoid language-specific syntax (like {}, ;)

Common Pseudocode Keywords:

INPUT – to take data

SET – to assign values

IF / ELSE – for decision making

FOR / WHILE – for loops

PRINT / OUTPUT – to show result


Palindrome
A word or sentence that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Duplicate
A value that appears more than once.

Sequence
An ordered list of numbers or elements.

Fibonacci
A sequence where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.









1-Start
2-Read list of numbers
3-Set sum = 0
4-Set count = 0

5-For each number in the list
    6-sum = sum + number
   7- count = count + 1
8-End For

9-average = sum / count
10-Print average
11-End
