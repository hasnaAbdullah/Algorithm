1. What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is an informal way of writing an algorithm using simple English and basic programming logic.
It is not a real programming language, so it does not follow strict syntax rules.

2. Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?
Why we use pseudocode:

To plan an algorithm before coding

To understand the logic clearly

To communicate ideas easily with others

To avoid syntax errors while thinking about logic

To make it easier to convert into any programming language later

When we use pseudocode:

Before writing actual code

During exams or assignments to explain logic

While designing algorithms

When learning programming concepts
